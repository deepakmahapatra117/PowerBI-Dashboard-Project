## Project Overview 

This project is a demo part of the project I worked at infosys, focused on building a
comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard. The goal was to help the Human Resources department
gain real-time insights and make data-driven decisions.

Overview:
The dashboard analyzes employee data to understand hiring trends, separations, tenure, and 
demographics across different business units and regions.
It also supports decision-making by providing interactive visuals and performance metrics.

Objectives:

Create calculated columns and DAX measures.
Design interactive reports and dashboards.
Implement row-level security by region.

Key Features:
Active Employees: Total number of current employees by gender.
New Hires & Separations: Tracks hiring and separation trends.
Tenure Analysis: Calculates average tenure in days and months.
Demographics: Visualizes employee age groups, gender, and region.
Row-Level Security: Restricts data access based on business unit region.

Tools & Technologies:
